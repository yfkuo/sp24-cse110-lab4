1. What was the bug?
    - Answer: num1 and num2 should be added as numbers, but num1 and num2 were treated as stings, so the (+) operation added them as combining two strings.

2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use) and add it to your expand/screenshots directory.
    - Answer: I would use a function to make sure num1 and num2 is converted into numbers before the (+) operation.
